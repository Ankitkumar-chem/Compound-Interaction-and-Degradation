        1. Stress degradation of Compound 1.
        2. Interactions between Compound 1 and any other provided compounds (Compounds 2-5).
        
        You MUST evaluate degradation under these specific conditions:
        - Oxidation
        - Acidic Hydrolysis
        - Basic Hydrolysis
        - Photodegradation
        - Thermal Degradation
        
        First, identify the chemical structures correctly for ALL provided compounds.
        For each compound, provide:
        - Identified name (If the user explicitly provided a name, you MUST echo their exact original name back to them. DO NOT rename it to IUPAC or another common name).
        - SMILES string (MUST be a valid, standard, canonical SMILES string compatible with RDKit and PubChem).
        - List of key structural features.
        - List of specific "Interaction Sites" likely to be involved in degradation.
        
        Predict exactly 10 possible degradation impurities or interaction products derived from Compound 1.
        For each product, you MUST specify:
        - Whether it forms from "Stress degradation" or "Interaction with other compound".
        - Which specific condition it forms under.
        - IUPAC name of the NEW DEGRADANT (do NOT just repeat the starting material's name. You must identify the unique name of the resulting product).
        - SMILES string of the new degradant. CRITICAL: This MUST be a valid, canonical SMILES string. You MUST implicitly verify that standard valences are not exceeded (e.g. Carbon max 4 bonds, Oxygen max 2 bonds, Nitrogen max 3 or 4 if charged) so that RDKit can successfully parse and render it. Invalid SMILES will break the UI renderer. If uncertain, simplify the resulting structure to ensure valence validity.
